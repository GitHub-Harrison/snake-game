# Snake Game
This is your typical basic snake game which I created by following a [tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/think-like-a-programmer-how-to-build-snake-using-only-javascript-html-and-css-7b1479c3339e), 
the idea behind this was to create something simple which I could then add onto. The tutorial creates a game that has the game area as a predefined and unchangeable size with no play again button or speed increase.

## Features
So far the features I have added to make this tutorial my own are the following:
* Game size selection (small, medium, large)
* Speed increase on X score
* Play again button
* Background music via youtube api
* Game over audio via youtube api

I am currently working on an audio prompt each time the snake eats the food, I then plan to move onto implementing a speed selection
option similar to the game size selection but instead for the starting speed of the snake.
