# Snake Game
This is your typical basic snake game which I created by following a [tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/think-like-a-programmer-how-to-build-snake-using-only-javascript-html-and-css-7b1479c3339e), 
the idea behind this was to create something simple which I could then add onto. The tutorial creates a game that has the game area as a predefined and unchangeable size with no play again button or speed increase.

## Features
So far the features I have added to make this tutorial my own are the following:
* Game size selection (small, medium, large)
* Speed increase on X score
* Play again button

I plan to add more features such as audio prompts on game ending and each time the snake eats the food,
as well as potential background music so the game seems less boring over long periods of playing.

Other features that could be added would be a scoreboard of local scores, a popup screen each time the game ends.
