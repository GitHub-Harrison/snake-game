# Snake Game
This is your typical basic snake game which I created by following a [tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/think-like-a-programmer-how-to-build-snake-using-only-javascript-html-and-css-7b1479c3339e), 
the idea behind this was to create something simple which I could then add onto. The tutorial creates a game that has the game area as a predefined and unchangeable size with no play again button or speed increase.

## Features
So far the features I have added to make this tutorial my own are the following:
* Game size selection (small, medium, large)
* Speed increase on X score
* Play again button
* Background music via youtube api
* Game over audio via youtube api
* Starting speed selection (slow + medium, fast to be implemented)

I am still working on the audio prompt for each time the snake eats the food, I am still having issues getting it working but I believe im on the right track to solving the issue. I have implemented the option to select a starting speed which works for both slow and medium however, the fast option seems to log the correct speed but on screen does not move at a faster speed than medium does.
